# New-Case-Setup

Python script to set up DFIR case organization. It creates a copy of your pre-made case template into an Analysis directory and creates a Desktop folder that you can drag and drop case files into. Dropped files are moved to the main directory, sorted by file extension and placed into corresponding folder. As you investigate and recieve files from different sources you can just drop them into Desktop folder and rest assured that case file are staying organized.

In addition, it creates a batch script on the Desktop to start the file-move process.

This greatly helps me keep organized!
